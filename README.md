## Various Brainteasing Algorithms

#### Linguistic chains
A Java program that finds the word from which one can remove the most letters, one at a time, such that each resulting word is itself a valid word

#### Arrays
* Rotate 2D array 90 degrees (clockwise and counter-clockwise
* Binary search in sorted array
* Binary search in 2D sorted array
* All character permutations in an array

#### Strings
* Segregate even/odd numeric characters in a string
* Reverse word characters
* Reverse word vowels
* Reverse sentence words, while keeping the characters in the correct order
* All character permutations in a string
* All word permutations in a sentence
* Check if two strings are anagrams
* Regex parser

#### Trees
* Create a balanced binary tree
* Count leaf nodes in a tree
* Find min depth of a tree
* Find max depth of a tree
* Invert a binary tree

#### Math
* Find missing number in sorted & distinct array of numbers
* Raise number to a power

#### Bitwise
* Power of 2
* Power of 4
* Count 1's in a binary representation of a number (several ways)
