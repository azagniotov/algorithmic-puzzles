## Various Brainteasing Algorithms

#### Bitwise
* Power of 2
* Next Power of 2
* Power of 3
* Power of 4
* Count 1's in a binary representation of a number (several ways)
* Find an array element that appears once among others that appear twice
* Find an array element that appears twice among others that appear once

#### Arrays
* Prints out 2D array in a spiral order
* Generates 2D array in a spiral order (both inwards and out)
* Rotate 2D array 90 degrees (clockwise and counter-clockwise
* Binary search in sorted array
* Binary search in 2D sorted array
* All character permutations in an array
* Find an array element that appears twice among others that appear once
* Concat N arrays into one, while keeping character order

### Strings
* Segregate even/odd numeric characters in a string
* Reverse word characters
* Reverse word vowels
* Reverse sentence words, while keeping the characters in the correct order
* All character permutations in a string
* All word permutations in a sentence
* Check if two strings are anagrams
* Check if two strings are isomorphic
* Regex parser
* Valid palindrome
* Check if string is numeric (ambiguous problem statement)

#### Trees
* Create a balanced binary tree
* Count leaf nodes in a tree
* Find min depth of a tree
* Find max depth of a tree
* Invert a binary tree
* Are two trees are the same

#### Math
* Find missing number in array of numbers
* Raise number to a power
* Test for prime

#### Linguistic chains
A Java program that finds the word from which one can remove the most letters, one at a time, such that each resulting word is itself a valid word
